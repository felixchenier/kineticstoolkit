Kinetics Toolkit
================

Kinetics Toolkit (ktk) is an in-house biomechanical library developed by
Professor Félix Chénier at Université du Québec à Montréal.

Most ot ktk is closed source for now. I usually wait several months before
releasing to ensure the modules are stable and mature enough to be shared.

If you are interesting in collaborating either in research or software
development, please contact me.

Please see this webpage for support: https://felixchenier.com/kineticstoolkit
